# Turbo

Allows to keep webpack react config in node module,
so its easier to update its dependencies and less boilerplate code in project

I've taken most of configuration from this boilerplate - [https://github.com/HashemKhalifa/webpack-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/HashemKhalifa/webpack-react-boilerplate)
It have MIT license at time of writing this.
Big thanks to Hashem Khalifa for creating this awesome Webpack/React configuration.

Ideas are also taken from **create-react-library** tool, which creates
Rollup React library module.

Turbo APIs library is build with Rollup. Web application code (your application basically)
is build with Webpack and runs in dev with webpack-dev-server.
Code to start webpack-dev-server is taken from **start-webpack-dev-server** module

Thanks to everyone creating good software.
